#### Load Libraries
```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

#### 1. Import the Sequences.csv file.
```{r}
Sequences = read.csv("../Rentrez/Sequences.csv")
```

#### 2. Count the number of each base pair (A, T, C and G), in each of the three sequences. (Hint: do not include any characters from the header, use the nucleotide sequence only; you MIGHT use gsub(), nchar(), for loops, if/then statements)
```{r}
#Create new column to store count data
Sequences$TotalBP = 0

#Count number of base pairs for each sequence using a loop
for (i in 1:3){
  
  #Remove all characters except for A,G,C, and T and count the total
  n = nchar(gsub("[^A|G|C|T]","", Sequences$Sequence[i]))
  
  #Store data in data frame
  Sequences$TotalBP[i] = n
}

#Display Results
Sequences
```
#### 3. Print out each sequence.
```{r}
print(Sequences$Sequence)
```
#### 4. Print out the number of each nucleotide as a table for each of the three sequences.
```{r}
#Create data frames to store data
Adenine = 0
Guanine = 0
Cytosine = 0
Thymine = 0

#Count number of each base pair for each sequence using a loop
for (i in 1:3){
  
  #Remove all characters except for A and count the number of A for each sequence
  a = nchar(gsub("[^A]","",Sequences$Sequence[i]))
  Adenine[i] = a
  
  #Remove all characters except for G and count the number of G for each sequence
  g = nchar(gsub("[^G]","",Sequences$Sequence[i]))
  Guanine[i] = g
  
  #Remove all characters except for C and count the number of C for each sequence
  c = nchar(gsub("[^C]","",Sequences$Sequence[i]))
  Cytosine[i] = c
  
  #Remove all characters except for T and count the number of T for each sequence
  t = nchar(gsub("[^T]","",Sequences$Sequence[i]))
  Thymine[i] = t
}
#Display Results
(DT <- data.frame(
Adenine = Adenine,
Guanine = Guanine,
Thymine = Thymine,
Cytosine = Cytosine,
Sequence = Sequences$Name
))
```
#### 5. Include an image of a bacteria from the internet, and a link to the Wikipedia page about Borrelia burgdorferi

[Link to Borrelia burgdorferi Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borrelia_burgdorferi)

#### 6. Calculate GC Content (% of nucleotides that are G or C) and create a final table showing GC content for each sequence ID, for example:
```{r}
#Add TotalBP to Nucleotide data frame 
DT$TotalBP = Sequences$TotalBP

#Calculate GC content for each sequence
DT %>% 
  summarise(Sequence_Name = c("HQ433692.1","HQ433694.1","HQ433691.1"), GC_Content = (DT$Guanine + DT$Cytosine)/DT$TotalBP)
```
